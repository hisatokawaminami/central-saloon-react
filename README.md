## README Prompts
1. I found that placing background image is tricky. I was able to display the image with `url(${background})` but it was only displaying for the lines that have contents in. Like, it was only showing the first line 'test' when I first deployed. I put a bunch on margin for a footer, so it kind look ok, but I still need to figure this out.

2. I had a issue when I tried to create routes. I learned that <html>, <head>, or <body> tags gives error. I had <body> tag when I was trying to figure out background problem.
